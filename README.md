# github-action-comment-test

This repository demonstrates how to use a bot of a GitHub App to send comments from GitHub actions.


1. create a github app here https://github.com/settings/apps/new
```
Name: <name of your bot>
Homepage URL: You can use the URL to your repo

Permissions:

Pull requests (read & write)
Issues? <- I used it because PR comments are actually sent via the issue comments API
Metadata (read only) [mandatory by default]
```

2. click on create App

3. (optional) Upload an image for your bot/app(e.g. CLA Assistant ðŸ˜Ž)

4. create private key by clicking **Generate a private key** and save the file on your computer. You'll later have to copy the content of this file into a secret of your GitHub Action.

5. Install your GitHub App into your org. 

6. Generate an JWT token for your App as decribed by [https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app](Authenticating as GitHub App)

This is an example for ruby. You'll need to enter your **APP ID** and the **path to the secret key file**:
```rb
require 'openssl'
require 'jwt'  # https://rubygems.org/gems/jwt

# Private key contents
private_pem = File.read(YOUR_PATH_TO_PEM)
private_key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(private_pem)

# Generate the JWT
payload = {
  # issued at time
  iat: Time.now.to_i,
  # JWT expiration time (10 minute maximum)
  exp: Time.now.to_i + (10 * 60),
  # GitHub App's identifier
  iss: YOUR_APP_ID
}

jwt = JWT.encode(payload, private_key, "RS256")
puts jwt
```
To try this code locally you need to install the jwt package:
```
sudo gem install jwt
```

To execute the snippet:
```
ruby my_file.rb
```
The script will then print the **JWT Token** on the command line.

The following steps make use of the GitHub Apps API to generate a token for your installation. This token can be used to post comments on a PR. https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/

7. Use the github apps API to get your installation. You need it to find the **installation ID**:


```
GET https://api.github.com/app/installations 
HEADERS:
  Authorization: Bearer <your generated JWT token>
  Accept: application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json
```

8. create an installation token via the API:
```
POST https://api.github.com/app/installations/:installation_id/access_tokens
HEADERS:
  Authorization: Bearer <your generated JWT token>
  Accept: application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json
```

9. Use the token to post a comment to your PR:

```
POST https://api.github.com/repos/:org/:repo/issues/:ID_OF_PR/comments
HEADERS:
  Authorization: Bearer <your installation token>

BODY (JSON):
{
  "body": "hello from github action"
}
```


To use this mechanism in a GitHub actions I guess you could simply do steps 6-9 on the fly. The only requirement will be that you store the generated key in a **GitHub Secret**.
